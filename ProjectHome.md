Specification:
> We need to create an app that can scan the bar-codes of various grocery items and
import their information to a server. Than, the app needs to send notifications to the
app owner in the form of an e-mail or text message on set times. In addition to that,
another wrinkle of the app is that there will be a diet section that will compare one's
> diet to a "perfect diet" and based upon that, a notification will be sent to the owner
> stating what items they should purchase more or less often to optimize their lifestyle.
